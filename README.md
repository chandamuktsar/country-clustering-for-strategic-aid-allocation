# Country Clustering for Strategic Aid Allocation - Group Project

# Description
This project analyzes socio-economic and health-related data to help HELP International, an NGO focused on poverty eradication and disaster relief, allocate its funds effectively.
The organization has raised $100 million and aims to identify countries that are in the direst need of aid. Using K-Means clustering, countries are grouped based on key indicators such as income, child mortality, health, and living conditions.
The clustering results help the CEO prioritize countries and plan targeted aid strategies for different groups, enabling data-driven and impactful decision-making.
